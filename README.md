* `yarn start` will serve your app on https://localhost:3000

---IMPORTANT NOTES---
* before working with packages in the project, make sure you work in the same nodejs version

  always make sure that you run `nvm use` before starting app or adding/building packages
  
  try to remember this so you won't run into any issues
  
* if you are going to install a 3rd party package/library always use yarn instead of npm,

  if you see `npm install <some package>` to install the package, replace the npm with yarn
